# The main trick was to use itertools product to create all the combinations of 0 and 1
# for the given number of repeats. This in a way resembles nested for loops, but one does not need to
# specify how many nested loops to use. Taking the results from the products we add the to a list of indices
# which we then give to the changeDigits method to replace those indices in the number with the given number.
