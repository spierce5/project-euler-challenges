# digit-fifth-powers
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
